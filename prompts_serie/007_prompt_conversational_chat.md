As an advanced programmer in Python, write a script that extracted content from ".csv" use the best library and you can use a temp file if needed.

To extract content from a ".csv" file in Python, you can use the built-in `csv` library, which is one of the best libraries for handling CSV files. Here's a script that demonstrates how to extract content from a ".csv" file:

```python
import csv

def extract_content_from_csv(file_path):
    with open(file_path, newline='') as csvfile:
        reader = csv.reader(csvfile)
        header = next(reader, None)  # Skip header row, if any
        content = [row for row in reader]
    return header, content

# Usage example:
csv_file_path = "path/to/your/file.csv"
header, content = extract_content_from_csv(csv_file_path)
print("Header:", header)
print("Content:", content)
```

Replace `"path/to/your/file.csv"` with the path to the ".csv" file you want to extract content from.

If you need to use a temporary file, you can use the `tempfile` module to create one. Here's an updated version of the script that uses a temporary file:

```python
import csv
import tempfile

def extract_content_from_csv(file_path):
    with tempfile.TemporaryFile() as temp_csv:
        with open(file_path, 'r') as csv_file:
            temp_csv.write(csv_file.read().encode())
            temp_csv.seek(0)

        reader = csv.reader(temp_csv, delimiter=',')
        header = next(reader, None)  # Skip header row, if any
        content = [row for row in reader]
    return header, content

# Usage example:
csv_file_path = "path/to/your/file.csv"
header, content = extract_content_from_csv(csv_file_path)
print("Header:", header)
print("Content:", content)
```

This version of the script reads the ".csv" file into a temporary file, extracts the content, and then closes the temporary file. This can be useful if you're working with multiple files or need to manipulate the content before extracting it.
