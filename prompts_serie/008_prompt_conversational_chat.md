## prompt
As an advanced programmer in Python, write a script that extracted content from ".csv" use the best library and you can use a temp file if needed.




Can you fix this python code below "---code" so the result is not empty 
Just an example of csv file in "---example"

"---example"
Teams,Name
Milwaukee Bucks,Giannis Antetokounmpo
Dallas Mavericks,Luka Doncic
Philadelphia 76ers,Joel Embiid
Denver Nuggets,Nikola Jokic
Los Angeles Lakers,Lebron James
Brooklyn Nets,Kevin Durant
Golden State Warriors,Stephen Curry
Memphis Grizzlies,Ja Morant
Boston Celtics,Jayson Tatum

"---code"

elif file_extension == "csv":
        try:
            # use tempfile because CSVLoader only accepts a file_path
            with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(delete=False, suffix=".csv", mode="w+t") as temp_file:
                temp_file.write(user_input_source)  # Write user_input_source directly to the file
                temp_file.seek(0)  # Seek to the beginning of the file
                temp_file_path = temp_file.name
                temp_file.seek(0)  # Seek to the beginning of the file again
                print("Contents of temp_file:", temp_file.read())  # Print the contents of temp_file
                temp_file.seek(0)  # Seek to the beginning of the file again
                reader = csv.reader(temp_file, delimiter=',')
                header = next(reader, None)  # Skip header row, if any
                text = [row for row in reader]
                print("text:", text)  # Print the contents of text
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error reading {file_extension.upper()} file:", e)

Certainly! For extracting content from a CSV file in Python, the `csv` module is the most suitable option. We can read the CSV file and extract its content using this module. Here's a script that demonstrates how to do this:

```python
import csv
import tempfile
import os

def extract_csv_content(csv_file_path):
    # Check if the file exists
    if not os.path.exists(csv_file_path):
        print(f"File {csv_file_path} not found.")
        return

    # Create a temporary file to store extracted content
    temp_file = tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(mode='w+', delete=False)

    try:
        # Open the CSV file
        with open(csv_file_path, 'r') as csv_file:
            # Create a CSV reader object
            csv_reader = csv.reader(csv_file)

            # Iterate over each row in the CSV file
            for row in csv_reader:
                # Write each row to the temporary file
                temp_file.write(','.join(row) + '\n')

        print("Content extracted successfully.")
        
        # Move the cursor to the beginning of the file
        temp_file.seek(0)
        
        # Read and print the content of the temporary file
        print("Extracted Content:")
        print(temp_file.read())
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error occurred while extracting content: {str(e)}")
    finally:
        # Close the temporary file
        temp_file.close()
        # Remove the temporary file
        os.unlink(temp_file.name)

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    csv_file_path = "example.csv"  # Change this to the path of your CSV file
    extract_csv_content(csv_file_path)
```

Here's a breakdown of the script:

1. The script defines a function `extract_csv_content` that takes the path to the CSV file as input.
2. It checks if the specified file exists.
3. It creates a temporary file using `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile` to store the extracted content.
4. It opens the CSV file using `open` in read mode and creates a CSV reader object using `csv.reader`.
5. It iterates over each row in the CSV file, writes each row to the temporary file, and adds a newline character after each row.
6. After writing all the content, it moves the cursor to the beginning of the temporary file and prints the extracted content.
7. It handles exceptions and ensures the temporary file is closed and removed at the end.
8. Finally, it demonstrates an example usage of the function by calling it with the path to the CSV file.

You can customize the script by changing the file path to your CSV file. Make sure the CSV file exists in the specified path before running the script.
