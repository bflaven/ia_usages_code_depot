## prompt
As an advanced programmer in Python using langchain, the following code "--- code" is printing an error see "--- error", can you fix the code and rewrite it if needed?  


--- error
TypeError: __init__() takes 1 positional argument but 2 were given

--- code
def call_string_output_parser():     
        llm_model = "mistral:latest"
        llm = Ollama(model=llm_model)
        parser = StrOutputParser
        prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([
            ("system", "Tell me a joke about the following subject"),
            ("human", "{subject}")
        ])
        chain = prompt | llm | parser
        return chain.invoke({"subject": "dog"})


print(call_string_output_parser())


## output
The error you're encountering suggests that there's an issue with the initialization of the `StrOutputParser` class. The error message indicates that you're trying to pass an argument to `StrOutputParser.__init__()`, but it only takes one positional argument.

To fix this, you should instantiate `StrOutputParser` properly, and ensure that it's compatible with the `langchain` library you're using. Assuming that `StrOutputParser` needs to be initialized without arguments, here's the revised code:

```python
from langchain import StrOutputParser, Ollama, ChatPromptTemplate

def call_string_output_parser():     
    llm_model = "mistral:latest"
    llm = Ollama(model=llm_model)
    parser = StrOutputParser()  # Instantiating StrOutputParser without arguments
    prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([
        ("system", "Tell me a joke about the following subject"),
        ("human", "{subject}")
    ])
    chain = prompt | llm | parser
    return chain.invoke({"subject": "dog"})

print(call_string_output_parser())
```

In this corrected version, `StrOutputParser` is initialized without passing any arguments, which resolves the `TypeError` you encountered. This should allow your code to execute properly.
