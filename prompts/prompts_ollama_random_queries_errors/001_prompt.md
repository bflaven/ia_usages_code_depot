## prompt
As an advanced programmer in Python using langchain, the following code "--- code" is printing an error see "--- error", can you fix the code and rewrite it if needed?  


--- error
ValueError: Invalid input type <class 'dict'>. Must be a PromptValue, str, or list of BaseMessages.

--- code
# V3
# model name
llm_model="mistral:latest"
# instantiate model
llm = Ollama(model=llm_model)
prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template("Tell me a joke about {subject}")
# create a LLM chain
chain = prompt | llm 
response = llm.invoke({"subject": "scientist"})


## output

To address the error you're encountering, it seems that the `llm.invoke()` method is receiving a dictionary as input when it 
expects a different type of input. Based on the error message, it appears that the `invoke()` method expects either a `PromptValue`, `str`, or a list of `BaseMessages`.

To fix the code, you need to provide the `invoke()` method with a compatible input. Assuming that you want to generate a joke about scientists, you should use a string instead of a dictionary. Here's the revised code:

```python
# V3
# model name
llm_model = "mistral:latest"
# instantiate model
llm = Ollama(model=llm_model)
prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template("Tell me a joke about {subject}")
# create a LLM chain
chain = prompt | llm 
response = llm.invoke("scientist")  # Providing a string instead of a dictionary
```

In this fixed code, we're passing the string `"scientist"` directly to the `invoke()` method, which should generate a joke about scientists based on the provided template.
