## prompt_1

As an advanced Prompt engineer and Python advanced programmerfor the 7B model released by Mistral AI, can you correct the prompt below "# SimpleSequentialChain" that categorize a post within the Interactive Advertising Bureau Content Taxonomy with the help a tags list e.g "France, Roman Polanski, trial, defamation, rape, sexual assault, French cinema, #MeToo" and the title "Filmmaker Polanski goes on trial in France on defamation charges".




# SimpleSequentialChain
llm_model="mistral:latest"

title = 'Filmmaker Polanski goes on trial in France on defamation charges'
tags = 'France', 'Roman Polanski', 'trial', 'defamation', 'rape', 'sexual assault', 'French cinema', '#MeToo'

SYSTEM_PROMPT = "You are a skilled content categorizer familiar with the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) Content Taxonomy. Your task is to categorize the given post using the provided tags and title, ensuring to follow the IAB categorization guidelines. Here is the format for your response:\n Content:{'title': {title},\n'tags': [{tags}]\n}\n Output Format:\n{'iab_tier1_category': 'value for iab_tier1_category','iab_tier2_categories': ['value1 for iab_tier2_categories', 'value2 for iab_tier2_categories', 'value3 for iab_tier2_categories']}\nContent: {content}"




# output
It seems like you're trying to create a Python script that uses a language model to categorize content according to the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) Content Taxonomy. Here's a corrected version of your prompt:

```python
# SimpleSequentialChain
llm_model="mistral:latest"

title = 'Filmmaker Polanski goes on trial in France on defamation charges'
tags = ['France', 'Roman Polanski', 'trial', 'defamation', 'rape', 'sexual assault', 'French cinema', '#MeToo']

SYSTEM_PROMPT = f"You are a skilled content categorizer familiar with the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) Content Taxonomy. Your task is to categorize the given post using the provided tags and title, ensuring to follow the IAB categorization guidelines. Here is the format for your response:\n Output Format:\n{{\'iab_tier1_category\': \'value for iab_tier1_category\',\'iab_tier2_categories\': [\'value1 for iab_tier2_categories\', \'value2 for iab_tier2_categories\', \'value3 for iab_tier2_categories\']}}\nContent: {{\'title\': \'{title}\',\'tags\': {tags}}}"

# Now, you would pass this SYSTEM_PROMPT to your language model for processing.
```

Please note that the actual categorization would require a deep understanding of the IAB Content Taxonomy and the ability to reason about the content based on the title and tags. This might be challenging for a language model, especially for more nuanced or complex content.

Also, the IAB categories are not provided in the script. You might need to map the tags and title to the IAB categories manually or create a function that does this mapping based on predefined rules.

Lastly, the `llm_model="mistral:latest"` line seems to be a placeholder. You would need to replace it with the actual code that initializes your language model.
