## prompt_1
As an advanced programmer, in Streamlit, create two fucntions:

First, a function named "load_bg_server" will load in the console only the following command "python -m http.server 4000", put a loading and then print the result in the sidebar element. Take care of the error.

Second, after the server is loaded from the function named "load_bg_server", create a second function "show_player" that load links for these three different files: whisper_express_player_chronique_de_ja_bell.html, whisper_express_player_grand_invite_international.html, whisper_express_player_mamane.html. The URLs are like LOCAL_PYTHON_SERVER_URL = "http://localhost:4000/". Make a mangeable code with pyhton list and mange the error too.




# output
Below is the code implementing the described functions using Streamlit:

```python
import streamlit as st
import subprocess
import requests

def load_bg_server():
    st.write("Loading background server...")
    try:
        subprocess.run(["python", "-m", "http.server", "4000"], check=True)
        st.sidebar.write("Background server loaded successfully.")
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError:
        st.sidebar.write("Error: Failed to load background server.")

def show_player():
    files = [
        "whisper_express_player_chronique_de_ja_bell.html",
        "whisper_express_player_grand_invite_international.html",
        "whisper_express_player_mamane.html"
    ]
    LOCAL_PYTHON_SERVER_URL = "http://localhost:4000/"
    
    st.write("Loading player links...")
    for file in files:
        url = LOCAL_PYTHON_SERVER_URL + file
        try:
            response = requests.head(url)
            if response.status_code == 200:
                st.write(f"Player link for {file}: {url}")
            else:
                st.write(f"Error: File {file} not found.")
        except requests.RequestException as e:
            st.write(f"Error: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    st.title("Streamlit Background Server Loader and Player Link Displayer")
    
    # Load background server
    load_bg_server()
    
    # Display player links
    show_player()
```

In this script:

- `load_bg_server()` function loads the background server using the `subprocess.run()` function to run the command "python -m http.server 4000". It catches errors if the server fails to load and prints the result in the Streamlit sidebar.

- `show_player()` function displays the player links by iterating through a list of file names and appending them to the base URL of the local Python server. It checks if each file exists on the server and displays the corresponding link. It handles errors if the file is not found or if there's any issue with the HTTP request.

Ensure you have the required files available in the directory where you run this script and that no other application is using port 4000 before running this script.



# prompt
The streamlit file keeps running even though the local server is ok but load_bg_server never get the answer back to certify that the server is up and running. Can you fix this?



To ensure that the `load_bg_server()` function gets the response back to certify that the server is up and running, we can implement a mechanism to check if the server has successfully started. We can achieve this by making a request to the server and waiting for a response.

Here's the updated code:

```python
import streamlit as st
import subprocess
import requests
import time

def check_server_status():
    url = "http://localhost:4000/"
    try:
        response = requests.head(url)
        return response.status_code == 200
    except requests.RequestException:
        return False

def load_bg_server():
    st.write("Loading background server...")
    try:
        subprocess.Popen(["python", "-m", "http.server", "4000"])
        st.sidebar.write("Background server is starting...")
        while not check_server_status():
            time.sleep(1)
        st.sidebar.write("Background server loaded successfully.")
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError:
        st.sidebar.write("Error: Failed to load background server.")

def show_player():
    files = [
        "whisper_express_player_chronique_de_ja_bell.html",
        "whisper_express_player_grand_invite_international.html",
        "whisper_express_player_mamane.html"
    ]
    LOCAL_PYTHON_SERVER_URL = "http://localhost:4000/"
    
    st.write("Loading player links...")
    for file in files:
        url = LOCAL_PYTHON_SERVER_URL + file
        try:
            response = requests.head(url)
            if response.status_code == 200:
                st.write(f"Player link for {file}: {url}")
            else:
                st.write(f"Error: File {file} not found.")
        except requests.RequestException as e:
            st.write(f"Error: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    st.title("Streamlit Background Server Loader and Player Link Displayer")
    
    # Load background server
    load_bg_server()
    
    # Display player links
    show_player()
```

In this code, the `check_server_status()` function checks whether the server is running by making a request to the server's root URL (http://localhost:4000/). The `load_bg_server()` function starts the server using `subprocess.Popen()` and then waits until the server is up and running by repeatedly checking the server status using `check_server_status()` function. Once the server is up, it updates the sidebar with a success message.


# prompt
It is working but in the console I got the error "OSError: [Errno 48] Address already in use" can fix this error by ensuring there is server running on the port at this address before launching the server.


# output
To address the "Address already in use" error, we need to check if the port is already in use before attempting to start the server. We can accomplish this by attempting to bind to the port before starting the server. If the port is available, we can proceed with starting the server; otherwise, we should handle the error gracefully.

Here's the modified code:

```python
import streamlit as st
import subprocess
import requests
import time
import socket

def is_port_in_use(port):
    with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as s:
        return s.connect_ex(('localhost', port)) == 0

def check_server_status():
    url = "http://localhost:4000/"
    try:
        response = requests.head(url)
        return response.status_code == 200
    except requests.RequestException:
        return False

def load_bg_server():
    port = 4000
    st.write("Loading background server...")
    if is_port_in_use(port):
        st.sidebar.write("Error: Port 4000 is already in use.")
    else:
        try:
            subprocess.Popen(["python", "-m", "http.server", str(port)])
            st.sidebar.write("Background server is starting...")
            while not check_server_status():
                time.sleep(1)
            st.sidebar.write("Background server loaded successfully.")
        except subprocess.CalledProcessError:
            st.sidebar.write("Error: Failed to load background server.")

def show_player():
    files = [
        "whisper_express_player_chronique_de_ja_bell.html",
        "whisper_express_player_grand_invite_international.html",
        "whisper_express_player_mamane.html"
    ]
    LOCAL_PYTHON_SERVER_URL = "http://localhost:4000/"
    
    st.write("Loading player links...")
    for file in files:
        url = LOCAL_PYTHON_SERVER_URL + file
        try:
            response = requests.head(url)
            if response.status_code == 200:
                st.write(f"Player link for {file}: {url}")
            else:
                st.write(f"Error: File {file} not found.")
        except requests.RequestException as e:
            st.write(f"Error: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    st.title("Streamlit Background Server Loader and Player Link Displayer")
    
    # Load background server
    load_bg_server()
    
    # Display player links
    show_player()
```

In this code, the `is_port_in_use()` function checks if the specified port is already in use by attempting to bind to it using a socket connection. If the port is in use, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Before attempting to start the server, we check if port 4000 is already in use. If the port is in use, we display an error message in the sidebar. Otherwise, we proceed with starting the server as before.


# prompt
Can you add status with loader for all the loading so I got a clean screen when everything is loaded?


# output
Certainly! We can add loading indicators for both loading the background server and loading player links. Here's the modified code with loading indicators:

```python
import streamlit as st
import subprocess
import requests
import time
import socket

def is_port_in_use(port):
    with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as s:
        return s.connect_ex(('localhost', port)) == 0

def check_server_status():
    url = "http://localhost:4000/"
    try:
        response = requests.head(url)
        return response.status_code == 200
    except requests.RequestException:
        return False

def load_bg_server():
    port = 4000
    st.write("Loading background server...")
    with st.spinner("Starting background server..."):
        if is_port_in_use(port):
            st.sidebar.write("Error: Port 4000 is already in use.")
        else:
            try:
                subprocess.Popen(["python", "-m", "http.server", str(port)])
                while not check_server_status():
                    time.sleep(1)
                st.sidebar.write("Background server loaded successfully.")
            except subprocess.CalledProcessError:
                st.sidebar.write("Error: Failed to load background server.")

def show_player():
    files = [
        "whisper_express_player_chronique_de_ja_bell.html",
        "whisper_express_player_grand_invite_international.html",
        "whisper_express_player_mamane.html"
    ]
    LOCAL_PYTHON_SERVER_URL = "http://localhost:4000/"
    
    st.write("Loading player links...")
    with st.spinner("Loading player links..."):
        for file in files:
            url = LOCAL_PYTHON_SERVER_URL + file
            try:
                response = requests.head(url)
                if response.status_code == 200:
                    st.write(f"Player link for {file}: {url}")
                else:
                    st.write(f"Error: File {file} not found.")
            except requests.RequestException as e:
                st.write(f"Error: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    st.title("Streamlit Background Server Loader and Player Link Displayer")
    
    # Load background server
    load_bg_server()
    
    # Display player links
    show_player()
```

In this code, we've used `st.spinner()` to display loading spinners while loading the background server and loading player links. This gives a clean visual indication to the user that some background task is in progress. Once the task is completed, the spinner disappears automatically.


# prompt
I got the error "BrokenPipeError: [Errno 32] Broken pipe" can you fix it?

# output
The "BrokenPipeError: [Errno 32] Broken pipe" error typically occurs when the Streamlit script is trying to write to the Streamlit server after the connection has been closed. This can happen if the script continues to execute after Streamlit has finished running.

To address this issue, we should ensure that the script terminates gracefully after completing its tasks. We can do this by using the `sys.exit()` function to exit the script after the tasks are completed.

Here's the modified code with the necessary changes:

```python
import streamlit as st
import subprocess
import requests
import time
import socket
import sys

def is_port_in_use(port):
    with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as s:
        return s.connect_ex(('localhost', port)) == 0

def check_server_status():
    url = "http://localhost:4000/"
    try:
        response = requests.head(url)
        return response.status_code == 200
    except requests.RequestException:
        return False

def load_bg_server():
    port = 4000
    st.write("Loading background server...")
    with st.spinner("Starting background server..."):
        if is_port_in_use(port):
            st.sidebar.write("Error: Port 4000 is already in use.")
        else:
            try:
                subprocess.Popen(["python", "-m", "http.server", str(port)])
                while not check_server_status():
                    time.sleep(1)
                st.sidebar.write("Background server loaded successfully.")
            except subprocess.CalledProcessError:
                st.sidebar.write("Error: Failed to load background server.")

def show_player():
    files = [
        "whisper_express_player_chronique_de_ja_bell.html",
        "whisper_express_player_grand_invite_international.html",
        "whisper_express_player_mamane.html"
    ]
    LOCAL_PYTHON_SERVER_URL = "http://localhost:4000/"
    
    st.write("Loading player links...")
    with st.spinner("Loading player links..."):
        for file in files:
            url = LOCAL_PYTHON_SERVER_URL + file
            try:
                response = requests.head(url)
                if response.status_code == 200:
                    st.write(f"Player link for {file}: {url}")
                else:
                    st.write(f"Error: File {file} not found.")
            except requests.RequestException as e:
                st.write(f"Error: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    st.title("Streamlit Background Server Loader and Player Link Displayer")
    
    # Load background server
    load_bg_server()
    
    # Display player links
    show_player()

    # Exit the script gracefully
    sys.exit()
```

In this code, I've added `sys.exit()` at the end of the script to ensure that the script terminates after completing the tasks. This should help prevent the "BrokenPipeError" from occurring.




# prompt
Still got the error with more precise message "Exception occurred during processing of request from ('::1', 58967, 0, 0)
Traceback (most recent call last):"


# output
The error you're encountering, "Exception occurred during processing of request from ('::1', 58967, 0, 0)", typically occurs when the HTTP server is terminated while a request is being processed. This can happen if the Streamlit script finishes execution before the HTTP server has fully started or while it's still serving requests.

To mitigate this issue, we need to ensure that the Streamlit script waits until the HTTP server has fully started and is ready to serve requests before proceeding. We can achieve this by introducing a delay or a loop that periodically checks the server's status until it's ready.

Let's make modifications to handle this:

```python
import streamlit as st
import subprocess
import requests
import time
import socket

def is_port_in_use(port):
    with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as s:
        return s.connect_ex(('localhost', port)) == 0

def check_server_status():
    url = "http://localhost:4000/"
    try:
        response = requests.head(url)
        return response.status_code == 200
    except requests.RequestException:
        return False

def load_bg_server():
    port = 4000
    st.write("Loading background server...")
    with st.spinner("Starting background server..."):
        if is_port_in_use(port):
            st.sidebar.write("Error: Port 4000 is already in use.")
        else:
            try:
                server_process = subprocess.Popen(["python", "-m", "http.server", str(port)])
                while not check_server_status():
                    time.sleep(1)
                st.sidebar.write("Background server loaded successfully.")
                server_process.wait()  # Wait until the server process finishes
            except subprocess.CalledProcessError:
                st.sidebar.write("Error: Failed to load background server.")

def show_player():
    files = [
        "whisper_express_player_chronique_de_ja_bell.html",
        "whisper_express_player_grand_invite_international.html",
        "whisper_express_player_mamane.html"
    ]
    LOCAL_PYTHON_SERVER_URL = "http://localhost:4000/"
    
    st.write("Loading player links...")
    with st.spinner("Loading player links..."):
        for file in files:
            url = LOCAL_PYTHON_SERVER_URL + file
            try:
                response = requests.head(url)
                if response.status_code == 200:
                    st.write(f"Player link for {file}: {url}")
                else:
                    st.write(f"Error: File {file} not found.")
            except requests.RequestException as e:
                st.write(f"Error: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    st.title("Streamlit Background Server Loader and Player Link Displayer")
    
    # Load background server
    load_bg_server()
    
    # Display player links
    show_player()
```

In this modified version, I've introduced `server_process.wait()` after the while loop to ensure that the Streamlit script waits until the server process finishes. This should help mitigate the "BrokenPipeError" by ensuring that the HTTP server process is not terminated prematurely.
