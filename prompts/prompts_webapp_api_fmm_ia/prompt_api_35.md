If looking at the project structure doesn't give you an idea of what the project is about, then the structure might be unclear.

If you have to open packages to understand what modules are located in them, then your structure is unclear.

If the frequency and location of the files feels random, then your project structure is bad.

If looking at the module's location and its name doesn't give you an idea of what's inside it, then your structure is very bad.



## prompt_1

As an advanced programmer in Python, with FastAPI, give the best tree directory for an API named "MaMaMIA" in order to have a clean tree and project structure. Make the project structure consistent and predictable. The API is REST. The goal of the API is to deliver all kind of IA. It relies on pydantic for models. The API is using for instance spacy, transformers, requests, pydantic, ollama, langchain

Here is the files used so far in the API

api.py # main file
data # it contains model for json files
lang_list.py # It contains the 200 languages list for the LLM named NLLB
ollama.py # A Class to leverage on Ollama to access to Mistral
prompts.py # Some prompts to query Mistral
requirements.txt # the requirements
spellchecker.py # A spellcheck using language_tool_python
translator.py # A Class to leverage on the 200 languages list for the LLM named NLLB
ux.py # A streamlit app that is connected to the API and query it


## output_prompt_1
Based on your description, here's a recommended directory structure for your FastAPI project named "MaMaMIA":

```
MaMaMIA/
│
├── api/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── api.py         # main FastAPI application
│   ├── models/        # Pydantic models
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   └── models.py  # define Pydantic models here
│   └── routes/        # API route definitions
│       ├── __init__.py
│       └── v1/        # Version 1 of your API
│           ├── __init__.py
│           └── endpoints.py  # define your API endpoints here
│
├── data/              # model for json files
│   └── your_data.json
│
├── lang_list.py       # list of 200 languages for NLLB
├── ollama.py          # Class for accessing Mistral using Ollama
├── prompts.py         # prompts to query Mistral
├── requirements.txt   # dependencies
├── spellchecker.py    # spellcheck using language_tool_python
├── translator.py      # Class for leveraging the 200 languages list
├── ux.py              # Streamlit app connected to the API
└── README.md
```

Explanation:

1. **api/**: This directory contains your FastAPI application. 
   - **api.py**: This is your main FastAPI application file.
   - **models/**: Contains Pydantic models used for request/response validation.
     - **models.py**: Define your Pydantic models here.
   - **routes/**: Contains your API route definitions. 
     - **v1/**: Versioning your API helps in future updates without breaking existing clients.
       - **endpoints.py**: Define your API endpoints here.
   
2. **data/**: Contains models for JSON files or any other data you might use in your application.

3. **lang_list.py**: Contains the list of 200 languages for the NLLB.

4. **ollama.py**: Contains a class for accessing Mistral using Ollama.

5. **prompts.py**: Contains prompts to query Mistral.

6. **requirements.txt**: Contains the list of dependencies for your project.

7. **spellchecker.py**: Contains spellcheck functionality using language_tool_python.

8. **translator.py**: Contains a class for leveraging the 200 languages list.

9. **ux.py**: Contains a Streamlit app connected to your API for user interaction.

This structure should keep your project organized, making it easier to maintain and extend in the future. Make sure to adhere to the PEP8 style guide for naming conventions and code style.


## prompt_2
Add some test to the directory tree 




## output_prompt_1
Certainly! Let's add a directory for tests in your project structure:

```
MaMaMIA/
│
├── api/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── api.py
│   ├── models/
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   └── models.py
│   └── routes/
│       ├── __init__.py
│       └── v1/
│           ├── __init__.py
│           └── endpoints.py
│
├── data/
│   └── your_data.json
│
├── lang_list.py
├── ollama.py
├── prompts.py
├── requirements.txt
├── spellchecker.py
├── translator.py
├── tests/                   # Directory for tests
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── test_api.py          # Test cases for your FastAPI application
│   ├── test_ollama.py       # Test cases for Ollama class
│   ├── test_translator.py   # Test cases for Translator class
│   └── ...                   # Add more test files as needed
│
├── ux.py
└── README.md
```

Explanation:

1. **tests/**: This directory is dedicated to storing your test files.
   - **__init__.py**: Marks the directory as a Python package.
   - **test_api.py**: Contains test cases for your FastAPI application.
   - **test_ollama.py**: Contains test cases for the Ollama class.
   - **test_translator.py**: Contains test cases for the Translator class.
   - You can add more test files based on your project's needs.

Remember to follow good testing practices, such as using a testing framework (e.g., `pytest`) and organizing your tests effectively. This will help ensure the reliability and maintainability of your codebase.
