## prompt_1

As an advanced programmer in Python, with FastAPI, give me explanations and code to illustrate how to manage this kind of architecture. Provide examples with coding for all files named in the directory tree below: 

MaMaMIA/
│
├── api/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── api.py         # main FastAPI application
│   └── routes/        # API route definitions
│       ├── __init__.py
│       └── v1/        # Version 1 of your API
│           ├── __init__.py
│           └── endpoints.py  # define your API endpoints here

Certainly! Let's start by explaining each file and then provide examples with coding for them.

1. **api.py**: This is the main FastAPI application file. It creates an instance of the FastAPI application and mounts the API routes.

```python
# api.py

from fastapi import FastAPI
from .routes.v1 import router as v1_router

app = FastAPI()

# Include API routes
app.include_router(v1_router, prefix="/v1", tags=["v1"])
```

2. **endpoints.py**: This file defines your API endpoints. It contains the route handlers for your FastAPI application.

```python
# api/routes/v1/endpoints.py

from fastapi import APIRouter

router = APIRouter()


@router.get("/example")
async def get_example():
    return {"message": "This is an example endpoint in version 1 of the API"}
```

These files provide a basic structure for setting up your FastAPI application and defining your API endpoints. Now, let's talk about how to run your FastAPI application and test the endpoints.

You can run your FastAPI application using the uvicorn server. First, make sure you have installed uvicorn and any other dependencies by running `pip install uvicorn fastapi`.

To run the application, navigate to the directory containing `api.py` and run the following command:

```
uvicorn api:app --reload
```

This command starts the uvicorn server, loads the FastAPI application defined in `api.py`, and enables auto-reloading so that the server restarts whenever changes are made to the code.

To test the example endpoint defined in `endpoints.py`, open your web browser or a tool like Postman and navigate to `http://localhost:8000/v1/example`. You should see the response `{"message": "This is an example endpoint in version 1 of the API"}`.

That's it! You now have a basic FastAPI application set up with an example endpoint. You can expand on this architecture by adding more endpoints, models, middleware, and other features as needed for your project.
