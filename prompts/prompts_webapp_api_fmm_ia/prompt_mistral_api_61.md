Sure, here's a detailed prompt that can be used to categorize a post within the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) Content Taxonomy with the help of a tags list and the title:

---

**Objective:** Categorize the given post within the IAB Content Taxonomy using the provided tags and title.

**Post Title:** "Filmmaker Polanski goes on trial in France on defamation charges"

**Tags:** "France, Roman Polanski, trial, defamation, rape, sexual assault, French cinema, #MeToo"

**Instructions:**

1. **Understand the Post Content:** Start by reading the title and understanding the context. The title suggests that the post is about a trial involving filmmaker Roman Polanski in France, with the charges being defamation. The tags provide additional context, indicating that the post may also touch upon topics like rape, sexual assault, French cinema, and the #MeToo movement.

2. **Identify Key Themes:** From the title and tags, identify the key themes of the post. In this case, the key themes could be 'Legal & Law Enforcement' (due to the trial), 'Entertainment & Celebrities' (due to the involvement of a filmmaker), and 'Social Issues & Causes' (due to the mention of sexual assault and #MeToo).

3. **Match Themes with IAB Categories:** Now, match these themes with the appropriate categories in the IAB Content Taxonomy. Here's a possible categorization:

    - **IAB Tier 1 Category:** News - Based on the title and tags, the post seems to be discussing a current event, which falls under the 'News' category.

    - **IAB Tier 2 Category:** Law, Crime & Safety - This category fits well with the theme of a trial and defamation charges. It could also include the topics of rape and sexual assault.

    - **IAB Tier 2 Category:** Arts & Entertainment - This category is suitable for the theme of French cinema and the involvement of a filmmaker.

    - **IAB Tier 2 Category:** Society - The mention of the #MeToo movement and the broader context of sexual assault allegations in the entertainment industry could fit under this category.

4. **Finalize Categorization:** After considering all the key themes and matching them with the IAB categories, finalize the categorization of the post. In this case, the post could be categorized under 'News > Law, Crime & Safety', 'News > Arts & Entertainment', and 'News > Society'.
