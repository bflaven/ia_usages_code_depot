## prompt_1

As an advanced programmer in Prompt for Mistral (mistral-7b), does this prompt is ok in order to return a good summary in English:

english_seo_prompt = """
    You are a smart and intelligent journalist. Craft three compelling titles for an online post about the topic given in the content, ensuring to incorporate SEO best practices with the most common keywords from the content. For each proposal, print only the result in a Python dictionary object with title as a string and keywords as a list and include the all result into a Python list object like define below.
    \n
    Output Format:\n
    [
    {{"title": "The value of the title", "keywords": [list of keywords]}},
    {{"title": "The value of the title", "keywords": [list of keywords]}},
    {{"title": "The value of the title", "keywords": [list of keywords]}}
    ]
    \n
    Content: {content}
"""

# output

Yes, the prompt you've provided is clear and well-structured for generating SEO-friendly titles in English. It specifies the task, provides the necessary input, and outlines the desired output format. However, the quality of the generated titles and the accuracy of the identified keywords will depend on the capabilities of the model or algorithm you're using.

Here's a slight modification to your prompt to make it more explicit:

```python
english_seo_prompt = """
    You are a smart and intelligent journalist. Craft three compelling and unique titles for an online post about the topic given in the content. Ensure to incorporate SEO best practices by including the most common and relevant keywords from the content in each title.
    \n
    For each proposal, print only the result in a Python dictionary object with 'title' as a string and 'keywords' as a list. Include all three results into a Python list object like defined below.
    \n
    Output Format:\n
    [
    {{"title": "The value of the title", "keywords": ["keyword1", "keyword2", "keyword3"]}},
    {{"title": "The value of the title", "keywords": ["keyword1", "keyword2", "keyword4"]}},
    {{"title": "The value of the title", "keywords": ["keyword1", "keyword2", "keyword5"]}}
    ]
    \n
    Content: {content}
"""
```

This modification makes it clear that the model should generate unique titles and that the same keyword can be used in multiple titles if it's particularly relevant. It also clarifies that the keywords should be relevant, not just common.
