## prompt_1

As an advanced programmer in Python, with Streamlit, write a script that enable this upload of an .mp3 that will interact with the endpoint "/audio-express". When the upload is done and the .mp3 trancripted. The API will send a json named "response". In the streamlit page, select the player of your choice to load the json "response" so when the user want to play the mp3, it shows below the player all the words and enlight in red the word that is player. See below the code for the json "response"

```json
{
    "language": "en",
    "language_probability": 0.9958502054214478,
    "segments": [
        {
            "start": 0,
            "end": 3,
            "words": [
                {
                    "start": 0,
                    "end": 0.42,
                    "word": " My"
                },
                {
                    "start": 0.42,

            ]
        }
    ]
}

Here's a Streamlit script that enables the upload of an .mp3 file and interacts with the provided endpoint "/audio-express". It also displays the words from the JSON response and highlights the currently playing word in red.

```python
import streamlit as st
import requests

# Function to fetch transcript JSON from the API
def fetch_transcript(audio_file):
    url = "YOUR_API_ENDPOINT_HERE"  # Set your API endpoint here
    files = {"file": audio_file}
    response = requests.post(url + "/audio-express", files=files)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.json()
    else:
        st.error("Error fetching transcript.")
        return None

# Function to display the player and transcript
def display_player_and_transcript(transcript):
    if transcript is not None:
        segments = transcript.get("segments", [])
        with st.expander("Transcript"):
            for segment in segments:
                for word in segment.get("words", []):
                    if st.session_state.current_time >= word["start"] and st.session_state.current_time <= word["end"]:
                        st.markdown(f'<span style="color:red">{word["word"]}</span>', unsafe_allow_html=True)
                    else:
                        st.write(word["word"], end=" ")
                    st.write("", end=" ")

# Main Streamlit app
def main():
    st.title("Audio Player with Transcript")

    uploaded_file = st.file_uploader("Upload an MP3 file", type=["mp3"])

    if uploaded_file is not None:
        # Display the audio player
        audio_bytes = uploaded_file.read()
        st.audio(audio_bytes, format="audio/mp3")

        # Fetch transcript and display
        transcript = fetch_transcript(uploaded_file)
        display_player_and_transcript(transcript)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Here's what the script does:

1. It provides a file uploader for users to upload an .mp3 file.
2. It sends the uploaded .mp3 file to the specified API endpoint ("/audio-express") to get the transcript JSON.
3. It displays the audio player for the uploaded file using Streamlit's `st.audio` function.
4. It displays the transcript below the player, with each word highlighted in red if it corresponds to the current time being played in the audio player.
5. You need to replace `"YOUR_API_ENDPOINT_HERE"` with your actual API endpoint.

Make sure your endpoint returns the correct JSON response as mentioned in the example. Additionally, this code assumes that your endpoint can handle file uploads and returns the expected JSON response. Adjustments may be needed based on your specific requirements and the behavior of your API endpoint.
