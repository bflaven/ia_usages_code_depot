        "keywords": ["German Government", "Budget Crisis", "Constitutional Court", "60 Billion Euros"]
    },
    {
        "title": "Scholz Administration Under Fire: Non-Compliant Accounting Procedures Trigger Extraordinary Budget Vote",
        "keywords": ["Scholz Administration", "Non-Compliant Accounting Procedures", "Extraordinary Budget Vote"]
    },
    {
        "title": "Germany's Unexpected Turn: The Impact of the Courts Decision on Berlin's Strict Fiscal Rules and Upcoming Budget",
        "keywords": ["Germany", "Court's Decision", "Fiscal Rules", "Budget"]
    }
