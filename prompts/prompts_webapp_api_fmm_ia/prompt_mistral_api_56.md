## prompt_1

As an advanced programmer in Prompt for Mistral (mistral-7b), does this prompt is ok in order to return a good summary in English:

english_summarize_prompt = """
    [INST] You are a helpful summarizer assistant. Your task is to generate a valid summary object based on the given information : content: {content}.
    \n
    For the proposal, print only the result in a Python dictionary object with the summary as a string and 5 keywords as a list and include the all result into a Python list object like define below.
    \n
    Output Format:\n
    [
    {{"summary": "The summary of the content"}}
    ]
    \n
    \n[/INST]
"""

# output

Yes, the prompt you've provided is well-structured and should work well for generating a summary in English. It clearly defines the task, provides the necessary input, and specifies the desired output format. However, it's important to note that the actual summarization and keyword extraction will depend on the capabilities of the model or algorithm you're using.

Here's a slight modification to your prompt to also include the requirement for 5 keywords:

```python
english_summarize_prompt = """
    [INST] You are a helpful summarizer assistant. Your task is to generate a valid summary object based on the given information : content: {content}.
    \n
    You should also identify 5 key words or phrases that best represent the content.
    \n
    For the proposal, print only the result in a Python dictionary object with the summary as a string and the 5 keywords as a list. Include the all result into a Python list object like define below.
    \n
    Output Format:\n
    [
    {{"summary": "The summary of the content", "keywords": ["word1", "word2", "word3", "word4", "word5"]}}
    ]
    \n
    \n[/INST]
"""
```

This modification makes it clear that the model should also return a list of 5 keywords along with the summary.
